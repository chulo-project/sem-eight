## 1.2 Cloud Computing Definition ⭐⭐⭐

### NIST Definition

"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

### Simple Definition

**Cloud Computing:** Delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet ("the cloud") with pay-as-you-go pricing.

---

- Standard protocols (HTTP, HTTPS)
- Cross-platform accessibility

### 3. Resource Pooling

- Multi-tenant model
- Resources dynamically assigned
- Location independence

### 4. Rapid Elasticity

- Scale up/down quickly
- Appears unlimited to users
- Automatic scaling possible

### 5. Measured Service

- Resource usage monitored
- Pay-per-use billing
- Transparency for users and providers

## 1.4 Types of Cloud Services ⭐⭐⭐

Covered in detail in Chapter 2, but overview:

| Service  | User Manages   | Provider Manages         |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| **IaaS** | OS, Apps, Data | Hardware, Virtualization |
| **PaaS** | Apps, Data     | OS, Runtime, Hardware    |
| **SaaS** | Nothing        | Everything               |
