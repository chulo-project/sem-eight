### Section A

**Attempt any two questions. (2 × 10 = 20)**

1. Define geographical object and field. Differentiate between raster and vector data models with illustrations. [10]
2. What are different coordinate and projection systems used in GIS mapping. Explain in brief. [10]
3. How Remote Sensing is different from GPS? Explain how Remote Sensing works? Differentiate between active and passive sensor? [10]

### Section B

**Attempt any eight questions. (8 × 5 = 40)**

4. Explain the functions of a GIS. How GIS is different from other Database Management System (DBMS)? [5]
5. Describe the main ways of acquiring data for input into a GIS. [5]
6. Describe the different types of vector overlay operations with suitable examples. [5]
7. What are the different errors in GPS? How they can be corrected? [5]
8. Describe the basic elements of the raster data model. Why a local operation is also called a cell-by-cell operation? [5]
9. Why do you most likely use a vector-based buffering operation, rather than a raster-based physical distance measure operation? Explain with examples. [5]
10. Explain what connectivity, adjacency and containment mean in vector topology. Provide an example for each. [5]
11. Describe spatial data infrastructure. Mention the contents of Metadata. [5]
12. Write short notes on: [2 x 2.5=5]
    a) Geoid and Ellipsoids
    b) Open GIS
