### Section A

**Attempt any TWO questions.**

1. Design and EER model for library management system having generalization and specialization hierarchies. The EER model should have disjoint and overlapping constraints with at least one of the entities having total participation. Use your own assumption for other concepts. Now convert the EER diagram into its equivalent relational model.
2. What are different concepts and features of object oriented databases? What is object relational model?
3. Define distributed database. What are the benefits of using distributed databases over centralized database? Explain availability, reliability, and scalability features of distributed databases.

### Section B

**Attempt any EIGHT questions.**

4. Why indexing is important to store data in database? What’s multilevel index?
5. What is aggregation? Explain with example.
6. Define ODMG Object model? What is Object Query Language (OQL)?
7. What is query processing? Differentiate query processing with query optimization.
8. Why query optimization is necessary? Illustrate on the choices of query execution plans.
9. Why fragmentation is carried out? Difference between horizontal and vertical fragmentation.
10. Why NOSQL system is essential? What are the different characteristics of this system?
11. What is spatial database? Explain the concept of trigger with an example.
12. Write short notes on:
    a) CAP Theorem
    b) Deductive database
